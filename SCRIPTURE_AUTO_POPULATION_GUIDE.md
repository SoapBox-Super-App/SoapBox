## How It Works

### Scripture Detection Pattern
The system recognizes various scripture reference formats:
- Standard: "John 3:16"
- With numbers: "1 John 3:16", "2 Corinthians 5:17"
- Ordinal: "1st John 3:16", "2nd Timothy 2:15"
- Roman numerals: "I John 3:16", "II Corinthians 12:9"
- Verse ranges: "John 3:16-17", "Romans 8:28-30"

### Built-in Verse Database
The system includes 30+ popular Bible verses for instant lookup:
- John 3:16, John 14:6, John 1:1
- Philippians 4:13, 4:6, 4:7, 4:19
- Psalm 23:1, 46:1, 91:1, 139:14
- Romans 8:28, 12:2, 6:23
- Matthew 5:16, 28:19-20
- And many more...

### Auto-Population Format
When a reference is detected, it expands to:
```
John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
```
