Designing a high-converting and spiritually resonant **Donation Page** for the **SoapBox Super App** requires blending **trust, storytelling, and usability**. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of how to design it effectively:

---

## 🛠️ STRUCTURE OF THE DONATION PAGE

### 1. **Hero Section (Top Fold)**

* **Headline:** “Give With Purpose. Fuel the Faith.”
* **Subtext:** “Your generosity empowers churches, transforms lives, and builds God’s kingdom.”
* **CTA Button:** `Give Now` (anchors to the form below)
* **Background Image/Video:** Authentic church moments (prayer, community, worship)

---

### 2. **Donation Form (Simplified UX)**

**Inline, single-screen form (no page reloads):**

| Field                     | UI Type                 | Notes                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| Payment Method            | Card/ACH/Apple Pay/GPay | Secure & fast                           |
| Note / Prayer Request     | Optional text           | Optional message to the church          |
| Final CTA Button          | `Donate Now`            | With loader animation & confirmation UI |
