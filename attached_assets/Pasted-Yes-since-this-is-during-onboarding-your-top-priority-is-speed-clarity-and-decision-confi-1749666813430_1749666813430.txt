Yes — since this is **during onboarding**, your top priority is **speed, clarity, and decision confidence**, not full-scale discovery. That **does change the recommendation** slightly. Here's a revised approach optimized for **simplicity + scalability**:

---

## ✅ Revised Strategy for Onboarding Church Selection

### 🎯 GOAL: Help the user **quickly choose or skip** church selection without overwhelm — while laying groundwork for deeper exploration later.

---

### ✅ 1. **Smart Suggestions (Top 3–5)**

Show a **curated shortlist** based on:

* 📍 User’s **location** (auto-detected or zip code input earlier)
* 🙏 **Denomination or preferences** from earlier onboarding steps
* 🧠 **Match %** (simple logic like shared ministries or church size)

**Example Display:**

```plaintext
Christ the King Lutheran – 45% Match
📍 1.2 miles • Lutheran • 200 members
[Join This Church]
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Search Bar (Optional, Non-Required)**

Allow users to:

* 🔍 Type partial names or locations
* 🧭 Use “Search near me” button

If nothing matches, suggest:

> “Didn’t find your church? Skip for now or join later in Settings.”

---

### ✅ 3. **“Skip for Now” Button**

Always offer a **clear opt-out**, especially for:

* Visitors
* Unaffiliated seekers
* Users from unlisted churches

> ⏭️ *“I’ll join a church later”*

---

### ✅ 4. **Minimal UI, No Filters During Onboarding**

Avoid dropdowns, multi-selects, or infinite scroll here. Save that power for **the full Church Discovery tab post-onboarding**.

| Match % Badge      | Shown only if data available                          |
| Performance        | Preload from cached region list or Supabase geo-query |

### ✅ Final Call: Keep it Fast, Friendly, Forgiving

> Think of this like Netflix asking for favorite genres — **quick guesswork now, richer customization later.**
