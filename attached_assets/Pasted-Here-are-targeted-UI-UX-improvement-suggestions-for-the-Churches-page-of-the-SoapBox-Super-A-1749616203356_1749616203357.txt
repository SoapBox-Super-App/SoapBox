Here are **targeted UI/UX improvement suggestions** for the **Churches page** of the SoapBox Super App Admin Portal, based on the screenshot:

---

### 🧭 Navigation & Layout

**1. Collapse Sidebar Menu**

* Allow toggling/minimizing the left sidebar for better focus and space on smaller screens.
* Add icons alongside menu items to help quickly identify sections visually.

**2. Tab Filtering or Categorization**

* If this list grows, it becomes unmanageable. Add filters or tabs (e.g., by denomination, location, or status).
* Optional: Add search or alphabetic filter (A–Z scroll bar or segmented buttons).

---

### 🖼️ Visual Hierarchy

**3. Visual Differentiation for Selected Church**

* Right now, the selected item (e.g., “Christ the King Lutheran Church”) uses a slightly darker shade of blue.
* Improve by adding:

  * A border or highlight glow
  * Icons for quick actions (🖊️ Edit, 📊 Stats, 🗑️ Delete)

**4. Better Section Titles**

* “Churches” could use a subtitle or stat like: “11 Active Churches”
* Add sorting options (e.g., Newest, Most Active)

---

### ⚙️ Functionality

**5. Quick Action Buttons per Row**

* Add inline action icons to each row:

  * 📅 Add Event
  * 🙏 New Prayer
  * 📖 Add Devotional
  * 🖊️ Edit
  * ❌ Remove

**6. Detect Duplicates**

* Two “Grace Community Church” entries—highlight possible duplicates with a warning or merge option.

---

### 🎨 Aesthetic Tweaks

**7. Adjust Button Design**

* “+ Add Church” button is large and center-heavy. Consider moving it to the right-hand corner with a floating "+" icon to match the FAB in the bottom right.

**8. Color Coding**

* Differentiate churches by status:

  * Active (green tag)
  * Pending (yellow)
  * Inactive (gray)
  * Invite Sent (blue)

---

### 📱 Mobile & Accessibility

**9. Responsive Design Check**

* Ensure this layout gracefully stacks for smaller screens.
* Add tooltip support for icons.
* Use larger hit areas for tapping rows or icons on mobile.

---

### ✅ Bonus: Admin Utility Features

**10. Bulk Actions**

* Checkbox on each row → bulk email, tag, or delete.

**11. Last Activity / Engagement Stats**

* Show church engagement stats directly in this list:

  * “Last event: June 1”
  * “17 active users”

Would you like me to mock up a redesign or code sample for any of these suggestions?
