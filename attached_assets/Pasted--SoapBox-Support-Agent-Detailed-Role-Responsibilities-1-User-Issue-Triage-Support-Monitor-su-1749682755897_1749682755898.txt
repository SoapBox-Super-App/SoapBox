Content moderation dashboard (flagged prayer/forum posts)

Subscription and billing dashboard with Stripe or internal integration

Notification system for flagged issues or abuse reports

Church directory search with role-based controls (edit church data, contact church admins)

🧪 Automations to Build
Smart triage: auto-tagging new tickets by category/urgency

Email parser for password reset / login issue templates
