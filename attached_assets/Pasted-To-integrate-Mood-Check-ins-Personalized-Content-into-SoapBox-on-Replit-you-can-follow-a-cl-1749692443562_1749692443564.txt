To **integrate Mood Check-ins + Personalized Content into SoapBox (on Replit)**, you can follow a clear modular implementation approach using modern frontend + backend architecture. Below is a **step-by-step integration plan** broken down into UI/UX, backend, database schema, and personalized content logic:

---

## 🔧 STEP-BY-STEP INTEGRATION PLAN

---

### 🧑‍🎨 1. **Frontend UI (React or React Native via Expo)**

**Location**: After user logs in or at start of Daily Devotion page.

**Component**: `MoodCheckin.tsx`

* Show a prompt like: *"How are you feeling today?"*
* Present emotion choices via emojis or icons (😇 😊 😐 😔 😭)
* Optional text input for a short reflection
* Submit button → triggers API call

**UX Tip**: Make it a 10-second interaction max. Keep it joyful, not clinical.

---

### 🧠 2. **Backend API (Node.js + Express or Supabase Functions)**

**Route**: `POST /api/mood-checkin`

**Payload Example**:

```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid-1234",
  "mood": "anxious",
  "notes": "Struggling with school today",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-11T15:00:00Z"
}
```

* Store the mood entry
* Optionally trigger personalization logic (see Step 4)

---

### 🧱 3. **Database Schema (Supabase or PostgreSQL)**

Table: `mood_checkins`

```sql
CREATE TABLE mood_checkins (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  mood TEXT CHECK (mood IN ('joyful', 'peaceful', 'anxious', 'lonely', 'tired', 'angry', 'grateful')),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

### 📚 4. **Personalized Content Engine**

On check-in, fetch 1–3 pieces of content based on mood:

```ts
const contentForMood = {
  anxious: ['Peaceful Devotional', 'Anxiety-Calming Prayer', 'Psalm 46'],
  joyful: ['Gratitude Playlist', 'Rejoice Devotion', 'Celebrate with Others'],
  tired: ['Rest Scriptures', 'Evening Reflection', 'Sleep Meditation'],
};
```

* Use this to populate home feed or modal after check-in.
* Can also surface suggested prayers, sermons, or AI-guided chat.

---

### 🔁 5. **Daily Reminder (Optional)**

* Use push notifications or emails to remind users to check in daily.
* Message example: *"🕊️ Check in with God today. How are you feeling?"*

---

### 🔐 6. **Admin Dashboard (Optional Future Phase)**

Allow pastors (Church Super Admin) to see anonymized, aggregated emotional trends:

* “Top 3 moods this week”
* “Mood trend line over 30 days”
* Flag severe mood spikes for possible intervention

---

### 🔍 7. **Privacy & Consent**

* Ensure mood data is **user-private by default**
* Offer opt-in toggle for sharing with church leadership or for spiritual care
* Use this language: *“Help us tailor encouragements for you. Only shared if you choose.”*

## 📦 Deployment Plan on Replit

1. Use **Replit Teams for Education** or **Replit Bounties** for scoped tasks
2. Host backend API as Express server or Supabase Edge Function
3. Store mood data in Supabase and retrieve with protected endpoints
4. Roll out gradually with a toggle in System Admin panel
