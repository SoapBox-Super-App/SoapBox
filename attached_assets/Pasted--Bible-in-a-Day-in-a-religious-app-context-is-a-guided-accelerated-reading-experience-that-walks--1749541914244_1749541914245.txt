“Bible in a Day” in a religious app context is a guided, accelerated reading experience that walks a user through the entire storyline of the Bible—or large portions of it—in one day. It’s not a full-text reading of all 66 books, but a thematically curated overview designed to help users grasp the big picture of Scripture in one immersive session.

📖 What “Bible in a Day” Means
A condensed, narrative-driven experience that gives users a crash course in the Bible’s key themes, people, and events—usually through selected readings, summaries, and media.
