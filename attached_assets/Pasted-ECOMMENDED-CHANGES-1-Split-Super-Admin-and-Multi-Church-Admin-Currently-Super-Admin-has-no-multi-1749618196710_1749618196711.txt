ECOMMENDED CHANGES
1. Split Super Admin and Multi-Church Admin
Currently, "Super Admin" has no multi-church capabilities, but some use cases (e.g., regional church oversight or denominational staff) may require managing multiple churches without full system privileges.

Add new role: Regional Admin or Multi-Church Admin

Between Super Admin and Church Admin.

Permissions:

Can manage assigned churches (not all)

No system settings

Can assign Church Admins to churches under their scope

2. Delegate Limited Moderation to Ministers
Ministers currently have no content moderation powers, which can limit churches with small teams. You could:

Allow them to moderate prayer requests and flag comments

Allow approval of posts only within assigned ministry areas (if tagging ministries to content is enabled)

3. Empower Staff With Optional Permissions
Staff is currently limited to ‚ÄúDraft Only‚Äù for content and no real permissions. Consider staff permission toggles:

Optional event creation

Optional comment moderation

Can assist in admin duties without being admins

This makes the role more flexible across churches of different sizes.

4. Refactor Member Directory Access
Right now, it's vague what ‚ÄúLimited‚Äù access for Members means. Recommend:

Define: Can they view any profiles? Or only see their own/friends?

Suggest: Only allow Members to see:

Verified staff

Pastors

Assigned small group leaders

Approved public bios (opt-in)

5. Add Audit Trail Permissions
Add permission: Audit Logs Access

‚úÖ Owner

‚úÖ Super Admin

‚úÖ (Optional) Multi-Church Admin

Track changes, role assignments, content approvals for compliance/security.

üß† UX/Implementation Suggestion
Add Role Templates to simplify church onboarding:

"Small Church (under 50)"

"Mid-size Church"

"Large Church w/ Ministries"

These preconfigure role scopes and permissions quickly.

‚úÖ Summary of Suggestions
Area	Recommendation
New Role	Multi-Church Admin or Regional Admin
Minister Permissions	Allow scoped moderation, prayer review
Staff Role Flexibility	Enable optional task-based permissions
Member Directory Access	Clarify and restrict with settings
New Permission Type	Add ‚ÄúAudit Logs Access‚Äù
UX/UI	Add role templates for rapid setup

Would you like this matrix exported or restructured into a Supabase role-permissions table, JSON schema, or a permissions policy script for implementation?
