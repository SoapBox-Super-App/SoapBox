Great instincts — this step in onboarding already looks polished, but here are **smart, inclusive enhancements** you can make to improve reach, clarity, and accuracy across age groups and church sizes:

---

## ✅ Recommended Enhancements

### 🧒 1. **Add Age Group: 13–17**

* **Why?** Many churches include youth group members (especially if your app supports youth ministry engagement).
* **Label Suggestion:**
  `13–17: Teen & Student Ministry`
* ✅ Make it optional if COPPA or age verification is a concern

---

### 🏛️ 2. **Refine Church Size Categories**

| **Label**                  | **Range**   | **Suggested Description**           |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **House / Micro Church**   | 1–50        | Close-knit, often home-based        |
| **Small Church**           | 51–200      | Intimate community feel             |
| **Medium Church**          | 201–500     | Balanced programs & groups          |
| **Large Church**           | 501–1,999   | Expanded ministries                 |
| **Mega Church**            | 2,000–9,999 | Large scale, multi-service          |
| **Super Mega / Multisite** | 10,000+     | Multi-campus, national/global reach |

> 🧠 Note: “Super Mega” sounds a bit informal. Consider:

* “Multisite Network”
* “National/Global Church”
* “Global Fellowship”

---

### ⚙️ Optional Feature: **Dynamic Tag Logic**

Let church admins **label their size + type** (e.g., “Small Reformed Church” or “Global Pentecostal Fellowship”) using a chip system after onboarding. This supports search/filter use later.

---

### 💡 UI/UX Enhancements

* Use **“Show More”** for additional church size tiers to reduce visual clutter.
* Consider **iconography** for each tier (e.g., house, church, campus, globe).
* Add a tooltip or info icon next to “Church Size” to clarify that the numbers refer to **average weekly attendance**, not formal membership (which varies widely).
