Your SoapBox Super App Admin Portal already has a clean and well-organized layout, but here are **high-impact UX/UI improvements** that would make it more intuitive, pastor-friendly, and efficient for everyday church use:

---

## ✅ **1. Global Enhancements Across the Portal**

### 🧭 **A. Persistent Navigation Aid**

* **Add a sidebar minimizer/expander** (for tablets and desktops)
* Include **tooltips** or **icon labels** when collapsed
* Add **search functionality** across modules (for quick access to “Member Rachel,” “Prayer Wall,” or “March Sermon”)

### 🧑‍🏫 **B. Contextual Guidance**

* Use **micro-coaching tooltips or banners** per tab:

  * Example: “Use this tab to manage your volunteers. Tap ‘+ Volunteer’ to get started.”
* Add a **? Help button** with 2-min walkthrough videos per section

## 📊 **2. Analytics Tab Improvements**

| Issue                             | Fix                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flat metrics (0% is discouraging) | Use **sparklines** or “—” if no data yet                 |
| Hard to interpret trends          | Add **comparison arrows** (e.g., +5% this week)          |
| Metrics lack emotional context    | Include tags like “Engaged,” “New This Month,” “Dormant” |

🧠 **Pro Tip:** Add **filter options** by church campus or ministry subgroup.

---

## 👥 **3. People Tab Improvements**

### 📘 Member Directory UX:

* Add **tags or filters by ministry role**: e.g., “Youth,” “Prayer Team,” “Worship”
* Enable **bulk actions**: assign to group, send message, export CSV
* Include **last active** timestamp

🧠 Bonus: Integrate quick-access to **“Message”** or **“Pray for Member”** button on each card

## ✝️ **4. Ministry Tab Enhancements**

| Issue                                        | Fix                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Content / Discussions / Prayers” are buried | Make **Prayers and Discussions** their own tabs or cards                   |
| No grouping of events by type                | Add color-coded categories: **Outreach, Internal, Prayer, Youth**          |
| Events are text-heavy                        | Add **icon + visual indicators** (📅, 🙏, 🧒, 🎶) and simple calendar view |

---

## 🧠 **5. Devotional Publishing Enhancements**

### ✍️ Workflow Improvements:

## 🏛️ **7. Settings (Church Info) Tab**

| Enhancement                   | Why                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Social Links autofill icons   | Cleaner UI and fewer errors         |
